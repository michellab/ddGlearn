Learning model directory.

Scanner_ALFRESCO.py uses bayesian optimisation to search for optimal hyperparameter settings. This script can be run per dataset, per node on a computing cluster.

keras_ddG_offset_learner.py will, given a specific set of hyperparameters, reiteratively split each dataset, predict, and plot histograms over a given amount of iterations.
